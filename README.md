# Liars-dice
Javascript dice game
Based on Red Dead Redemtion mini-game.
Currently this projects runs, however it is prone to user error.
The "spot on" button is also not functional.
Eventualy the ai players should be able to call bluffs on each other.
Ai players will also soon be able to call bluffs/spot ons based on their own hands not overall probability.
Game will use dice images instead of numbers
